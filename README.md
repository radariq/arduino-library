# Arduino Library

The RadarIQ sensor integration with Arduino is available via an Arduino library.

The RadarIQ-M1 sensor is an easy-to-use radar sensor for detecting objects and measuring distance and speed.
All the difficult parts of working with radar are done by the sensor and a simple API and SDK provide an easy
path to integration.
